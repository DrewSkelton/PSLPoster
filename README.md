# A Modern Approach to Greenhouse Gas Tracking - the Software-Driven Portable Soil Lab

## Background Information: 
One of the main goals of ecosystem science is to understand greenhouse gas efflux from and accumulation in soil to better quantify how land cover and land use change impacts soil respiration and the carbon cycle. However, there is a significant need for a reliable and inexpensive method of soil sensing to gather a large quantity of high-quality data from various locations of interest, as current “ruggedized” sensor soil insertion methods suffer high fail rates in the field alongside difficult installation and high cost.
 
To address this science need and technological gap, we are working on development of a portable sampling and sensor device to support current NSF-funded Critical Zone projects on carbon accounting and soil quality along with fugitive gas monitoring from oil and gas infrastructure with the goal of making significant strides in affordability, reliability, functionality, and ease-of-use with a field deployable custom hardware architecture coupled with user-friendly and lightweight modern software.
 
## Thesis: 
Software modifications to the Portable Soil Laboratory (PSL) are being targeted to guide experiment flow for consistency, implement custom graphing for greater insights, and build efficient cloud infrastructure to eliminate current high costs and ensure sensor reliability. These changes will benefit existing environmental research in C-cycle monitoring and soil health as well as planned programs with Tribal Nation offices of environmental services and natural resources within Oklahoma to monitor methane leaks in legacy oil and gas infrastructure. 
 
## Methods: 
An Express.js database coupled with regular data backups and automatic experiment saving ensure persistence through unpredictable field environments. A creative, Domain-Driven Design approach to building Chart.js feeds and Angular user interfaces allows for interactive visualization of live data streams. The addition of internet access hardware capabilities to the lightweight onboard Raspberry Pi computer system and the development of cost-effective AWS servers interact to facilitate easy remote access to the PSL's Express data and controls.
 
## Results: 
Updates saved over $2000/year payments on external Software as a Service (SaaS) which increased lab funding/capability. Many significant inhibitors to lab productivity within the PSL system such as unorganized user controls, illegible charts, and lack of consistent data backups were eliminated, increasing experiment speed, data post-processing speed, and meaningfulness of in-field insights.
 
## Conclusion: 
Members and colleagues of our lab can use the new device at a much lower cost with a higher experiment speed and experiment quality when provided with this mass-producible Portable Soil Laboratory and minimal and organized training. These practices help to improve research quality and field use when monitoring soil contents to better industry practices and environmental monitoring/protections.
